1) Sorting of array [16,21,11,8,12,22] to merge sort;
  We seperate all nodes until a node left;

   [16,21], [11,8], [12,22]

   [16], [21], [11], [8], [12], [22]



   Merge it by grouping
 
   [16,21], 11 ,  [8,12], 22
 
   [11,16,21],   [2,12,22]
 
   [8,11,12,16,21,22]
 
 
 
 
 
 2) Big-O Notation
